# bulletPurgatory

This is a shoot 'em up made using the godot engine. It features dialog systems, a combat system with cooldowns, sound effects, and different enemies with different attacks.
It is divided into 3 levels, each of which is separated into different stages. If the player dies they respawn at the beginning of the current stage.
